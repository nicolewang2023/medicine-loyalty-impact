# medicine-loyalty-impact

This project analyzes how pharmacy loyalty programs affect medication purchase behavior, focusing on quantity purchased and price per unit across different product categories.

### Project Origin and Context
This project is adapted from a Brattle case study. All confidential information has been either removed or replaced with synthetic equivalents to ensure anonymization and generalizability.

### Project Context
Foresight is a fictional third-party analytics company that compiles anonymized transactional and program participation data from medical manufacturers.

In this project, we focus on two major manufacturers:
- **Symptom Bio**
- **Cilios Bio**

Each manufacturer maintains a database:
- `symptom_bio`: documents which active ingredients (AIs) and which buyers participated in loyalty programs offered by Symptom Bio each year
- `cilios_bio`: does the same for Cilios Bio

### Key AIs of Interest
We focus on six active ingredients that are central to loyalty strategies:
1. **Amlodipine**
2. **Alprazolam**
3. **Duloxetine**
4. **Hydrochlorothiazide**
5. **Rivaroxaban**
6. **Amiodarone**

### Research Objective
The goal of this project is to investigate the effect of participating in loyalty programs on the sales of these AIs across buyers. We analyze both volume and pricing outcomes to assess how loyalty programs influence purchasing behavior.
